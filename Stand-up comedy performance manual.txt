Stand-up comedy performance manual
# Welcome to the world of stand-up comedy.

Standup comedy originated in England and developed in the United States. It is a live theater performance where actors perform funny jokes on stage. 

### Stand-up comedy is a highly practiced art.

Nice jokes are not thoughts out at home. Performer creative jokes and improve them again and again after the performance.

### Stand-up comedy is the most original art.

Traditional comedy performances, such as sketch and crosstalk, are separated from writers and performances. Performers don’t necessarily need to learn how to create jokes. Therefore, stand-up comedy is highly original, so performers’ jokes are often based on their experiences. If you are an IT worker, forced by your parents to marry, and don’t like spicy food, your performance materials will also come from these contents.

💡 If a joke can steal, it’s not a good one.

You aren’t a joke reporter. Your performance on the stage is not ”Today I wrote three jokes, the first one is… the second one is… the third one is… “ Instead, “Hello everyone, I think girls are becoming more and more challenging to pursue because I am a living example. “ Let the audience know that as an actor, you are a live person who is the same as everyone, and your topics are closely related. On the contrary, if a joke has nothing to do with your or the audience, it will be very similar to the network jokes on the microblog. If you speak network jokes on the stage, the audience may think, I could have seen such jokes on a microblog. Why should I spend time watching your speak? Didn’t I come to see what I couldn’t
Therefore, stand-up comedy differs from other comedy forms in that you must be yourself on the stage. Everything you say on the stage comes from your most authentic attitude and thinking. What you need to do is not makeup jokes but turn things in your life into jokes. You need to find your true style in regular performance.
