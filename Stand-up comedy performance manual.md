# Stand-up comedy performance manual.

# Welcome to the world of stand-up comedy.

Standup comedy originated in England and developed in the United States. It is a live theater performance where actors perform funny jokes on stage. 

### Stand-up comedy is a highly practiced art.

<aside>
💡 A basic standard for your jokes is whether the audience laughs.

</aside>

Nice jokes are not thoughts out at home. Performer creative jokes and improve them again and again after the performance.

### Stand-up comedy is the most original art.

Traditional comedy performances, such as sketch and crosstalk, are separated from writers and performances. Performers don’t necessarily need to learn how to create jokes. Therefore, stand-up comedy is highly original, so performers’ jokes are often based on their experiences. If you are an IT worker, forced by your parents to marry, and don’t like spicy food, your performance materials will also come from these contents.

<aside>
💡 If a joke can steal, it’s not a good one.

</aside>

You aren’t a joke reporter. Your performance on the stage is not ”Today I wrote three jokes, the first one is… the second one is… the third one is… “ Instead, “Hello everyone, I think girls are becoming more and more challenging to pursue because I am a living example. “ Let the audience know that as an actor, you are a live person who is the same as everyone, and your topics are closely related. On the contrary, if a joke has nothing to do with your or the audience, it will be very similar to the network jokes on the microblog. If you speak network jokes on the stage, the audience may think, I could have seen such jokes on a microblog. Why should I spend time watching your speak? Didn’t I come to see what I couldn’t
Therefore, stand-up comedy differs from other comedy forms in that you must be yourself on the stage. Everything you say on the stage comes from your most authentic attitude and thinking. What you need to do is not makeup jokes but turn things in your life into jokes. You need to find your true style in regular performance.

# Write the premise.

## 1. preparation.

### 1.1. Establishing the right impression.

First think about whether you understand what stand-up comedy means and it’s the same thing as what you think stand-up comedy is. You can find the performances of George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle on the Internet. Due to the different cultural backgrounds of China and the United States, each performer’s style is also very different. Therefore if you feel that you don’t understand what is so funny about this person when watching a performance. Please don’t be stubborn about it and change to a performer you find interesting. The performers you find interesting is often the one that resonates with you the most, and you can learn more from them.
In addition, you look for comedy clubs and regularly hold shows and open mics where you can see the show live and learn a lot from it.

### 1.2. Record ideas at any time.

You need to keep track of ideas and think about jokes. Most performers are recorded on their phones, and I recommend you do the same. Be careful.

- When the inspiration flashes, write it down immediately. Most of the time, you think, “I’ll write it down later,” but you can’t remember it after a while. It will not come back to you after a time.
- You don’t have to record everything you think about precisely. Just write down the key phrases so that you can understand them.

You have to keep track at any time. You never know when you will have a flash of light. Good ideas and suitable materials are not products of hard thinking but are found anytime. 

In addition, I don’t recommend that you use the recording function. The recording is hard to organize and retrieve. Now there is some suitable input method that can directly convert voice into text.

Before writing a joke, divide your notebook into two columns with a vertical line of 2:1 in width. Write a story in a broader column. If you have any inspiration in the process of writing, quickly write it in another column with keywords, and then continue to write.

### 1.3. Sign up for an open mic.

Open Mic is a free stand-up comedy performance. Beginners and veteran performers can sign up to tell jokes for about five minutes each. Open mics are usually held in small bars on non-weekends, and performers sign up in advance with the organizers.

The purpose of the open mic is twofold, the first is to improve your performance skills, and the second is that after you have written new jokes, you need to try them out in this informal performance and tell them to the audience on stage to see how people react. If people respond in general, you need to keep revising your work.

Open mic performances are a must for both foreign and domestic stand-up comedians. Almost all must attend open mics several times a week to maintain their current level of performance and create new jokes.

Before you learn how to write jokes, sign up for an open mic gig a week from now and make sure you get it down. People are always lazy, If no perform. If it forces you ahead, you never start writing jokes.

## 2. Structure of jokes.

Next, let’s talk about the creation of jokes. Let’s briefly understand the composition of jokes.

<aside>
💡 A joke consists of two parts:                                                                                       Foreshadowing (not funny part) + baggage (funny part)

</aside>

The reason why people laugh is that the previously assumed emergency has disappeared. What happened now is different from what you predicted, which is an emotional release.  We call this mechanism “defies expectation,” and any joke defies expectation. When Chaplin walks, his feet are splayed out, which makes you find it funny. Although he didn’t say anything, it defies expectations - because he walks differently from the average person walking(what you previously predicted) is not the same. If an alien, who has never seen a human being, will not find it funny to see Chaplin walking because he has no prediction at all about how people walk.

When you look at it this way, the part of the baggage that makes you laugh is that it defies expectations :

<aside>
💡 Joke =                                                                                                     Foreshadowing (the part that’s not funny, the part you expected) +                              Baggage (the humorous pieces, the part was unexpected.)

</aside>

Using a classic joke as an example:

At the movie’s beginning, an older man leans under his seat and searches around. The neighbor asked, “What are you doing?” 

Old man: ”Look for chewing gum.” 

Neighbor: “Can’t you look for it after the show? Let’s not let people watch the movie.” Old man: “That can’t; My gold dentures are stuck on it.”

The part you expected: the older man’s candy fell on the ground, and he had to keep looking for it, and he couldn’t eat it even if he found it, so the older man was stingy.

The part you didn’t expect: the older man’s gold dentures are stuck on it. And he has to find them.

Figuring this out, writing a joke can be broken down into two basic steps: foreshadowing and baggage.

Example:

A: What is the target of the terrorists?
B: Harvard University.
A: What is the situation now?                                                                                             B: He had passed the exam.

Part of what you expect: Terrorists threaten Harvard University.
Parts you didn’t expect: The terrorists were admitted to Harvard University.

Which of these two parts will take more time to write? Many people think it’s the baggage part, but there is a saying that ”You can't make something out of nothing.” without concrete material as foreshadowing, the baggage is like a building in the air. It’s easy to fall into the stereotypes of network jokes, which seem very unrealistic. In addition, if the foreshadowing doesn’t attract the audience’s interest, it’s difficult for the audience to continue to listen to the next. The audience will rapidly judge you after you are on stage. 

<aside>
💡 When you are a beginner, you should spend more time writing foreshadowing and don’t want to write the baggage immediately.

</aside>

When you have a lot of material, you’ll be more eloquent on stage instead of telling jokes for the sake of telling jokes and become a network joke announcer.

**So, what is the foreshadowing? The foreshadowing is the preparation of the joke, which is divided into three parts.**

<aside>
💡 Foreshadowing = topic + premise + attitude

</aside>

**The topic is the main topic of the joke you are talking about, such as work, transportation, location, relationships, parents, etc.**

**A premise is a specific viewpoint on a topic. Your jokes will revolve around this premise. Sometimes we refer to the premise, also called the viewpoint or central idea.**

**Attitude is the emotion you show in this foreshadowing.**

Example of foreshadowing:

1) .“Zhengzhou’s epidemic is too bad.”

Topic: Zhengzhou’s epidemic.

Premise: Zhengzhou’s epidemic is too bad.

Attitude: agitation(manifest emotion)

2). “I found that many guys are very annoying, they want to break up with you, but they     don’t take the initiative to mention, by suddenly silent treatment to you, let your break up to him….”

Topic: relations between the two sex

Premise: Boys who want to break up will let you break up with silent treatment.

Attitude: disgust(manifest emotion)

**The performers may not directly express the attitude in the foreshadowing, but there must be. For instance:**

“In college, no one forced me to fall in love. Everyone started to push me to marriage once I worked.”

**The context can also judge that the comedian’s attitude at the moment must be irritable or helpless.**

## 3. Writing premise.

<aside>
💡 All jokes should have an attitude.

</aside>

Expressions without attitude are lectures and expository texts, not jokes. How to find the premise through theme and attitude? A common method is to select a topic and ask yourself how you feel about it in four different attitudes: **difficult, strange, scared, and stupid**. Then answer these questions. These answers are your premises.

For example, ask yourself the following four questions about a given topic:

- **What is it that makes it difficult for me?**
- **What makes me feel weird?**
- **What scares me?**
- **What makes me feel stupid?**

Now let’s give a theme: taking a taxi. See how to mine more premises from this topic. 

**What makes it difficult for me to take a taxi?**
- A 15-minute journey would take half an hour to wait for the driver to take the order.
- It is costly to take a taxi in Beijing.
- When I call a DiDi, sometimes when it rains heavily, the price is twice as high as a cab.
- When the driver picks up the order, the distance is very close, but it takes a big circle to pick you up.
- When carpooling, several groups of people are in the car, and it feels like a bus ride.
- The driver will complain if you take a taxi in a different direction than the driver wants to go.
- The car I called on DiDi was especially far away from me.

**What's the weird thing about taking a taxi?**
- Many cars are empty but don't stop when you wave.
- Why do you think the traffic department doesn't support it when it's so obvious that it can relieve traffic pressure?
- Some drivers love to express their opinions on current affairs, but they say the exact words to every passenger. Don't they get tired of it?

**What scares me about taking a taxi?**
- The smell in some cars is very strong, and the driver is still smoking.
- Some drivers drive fast as if they don't want to die and always feel he is in a hurry.
- There are many cars and pedestrians where you are afraid of getting into a car accident.
- Drivers keep cursing at passersby and other drivers and ask you if they are stupid, and you have to be vague.
- Drivers look at their cell phones while driving, and some are typing.

**What makes me feel stupid about taking a taxi?**
- Some drivers don't even know some of the most basic roads.
- Some drivers see you wearing a seat belt and think you don't trust your driving skills.
You want to wear the seat belt when particularly inconvenient.
- The navigation is on because you don't know the way, but the navigation signal is unstable.
- The driver and I both hoped that the passenger was a beautiful woman, but we both sighed when we found out otherwise.
- Some drivers know the way themselves but must take the trouble to discuss with you how to go.
- The online taxi driver is always half a beat slower when communicating with you.
- The voice navigation system always says strange things.
- The driver sometimes argues with the navigation.

When writing the premise, please pay attention to the following issues:

- Be sure to write with true feelings. You can only write like this if you think so. Don't copy what others say.
- You have noticed that these four attitudes are all negative. It would help if you chose a negative attitude as a joke. Remember when people laugh to ease the tension? Only negative emotions can trigger tension and relieve tension through baggage. If you express positive feelings, say, "Today, my boyfriend bought me a iPhone, and I am very happy." The comedian were very happy, but the audience was unhappy because no one sent them iPhone.
- Of course, there are more than "difficult, strange, scared, and stupid" attitudes in the jokes, but these four practices have proved easier to write. You can start with them. When you are proficient, you can certainly choose other words.
- Be sure to write more, and come up with a topic to write about daily. You have to exercise your short-time recall and brain power at this stage. Quantity is far more important than quality. Don't think, "this feeling is boring as if you can't write a joke." You don't know whether the joke will be funny.
- Although it is necessary to find material from your life, you should not use the words "I, we, my" in your premise. Because if you emphasize too much the unique information related to yourself in the premise stage and ignore the resonance of the audience, the audience will be difficult to continue to listen.

# Write more themes and premises.

## 1. Write original themes

### 1.1. Your life is a joke

I sometimes hear new actors say I don't know how to find material. My life looks pretty dull. Your life may be boring, but it doesn't mean your jokes will be boring.

The jokes are different from the anecdotes in your life. You think that the exciting things in your life are usually only suitable for your friends to hear at a party, and they are often cold fields on the stage because the materials in life need to be processed to become exciting things. So it doesn't need your life to be "fun." Only the jokes you write are fun. Comedians need to dig out good themes in seemingly dull, boring daily life and then turn them into jokes.

### 1.2. Refine your themes

There is a saying that “the devil hides in details.” The more specific the topic you say on the stage, the more likely you will impress the audience. “Asian” is a big topic, “Asian American” is a more specific topic, “Family education of Asian American” is a minor topic, and “Children’s memories under the education of Asian American parents” is a little topic. When you mention” Asian,” you think of abstract and general concepts. When you think of “Children’s memories under the education of Asian Americans,” you think of specific images: Strict parents, many remedial classes after class, help your immigrant family succeed by becoming a lawyer or doctor….When you refine the theme, you should see some very graphic images in your mind. These are your most vivid memories. Grab them.

### 1.3. From the themes to themes that resonance

As we mentioned before, try not to include words like “I, we, my” in your premise because often, your experience is too personal to resonate with the audience, and your topic needs to be relevant to the audience. Otherwise, it’s hard for them to be interested in listening.

Negative example: 

> My mom always urged me to find a girlfriend. I was forced to go to the bar with my buddy daily to wait for opportunities. My mom saw all this, but she began to worry more about me being with my buddy.
> 

This kind of thing is only interesting to you. The audience thinks it has nothing to do with the audience’s life. It’s just a wonderful experience for you. Unless you are a celebrity, people will not listen to it.

We said before that you should refine your theme, which requires that the theme is highly related to your personal experience. But at the same time. It’s required not to say the words containing “I, we, my” to appear too personal. Is this a contradiction? Try to compare the following two topics:

1. My brother dropped out of school because of puppy love.
2. My brother likes Japanese anime very much.

Both talked about the special problems of relatives, which were personal experiences. But obviously, the second one is more resonant because it’s a more common phenomenon to like Japanese anime. But the second one is still not enough to resonate because “brother likes Japanese anime” may still be rare, so we can further rewrite the second theme, such as “people who love Japanese anime around.” The theme selection requires you to balance your personal experience and audience contact.

I found that the premise doesn’t resonate with the problem that new comedians always make mistakes because we don’t often need to communicate with strangers in our daily life. When socializing with acquaintance, the chat content has already been understanding each other, so deliberately creating resonance when speaking is unnecessary. Still, dating strangers is not the same. The most important thing when chatting with strangers is to make a topic that both can participate in. New comedians on stage are the same as socializing with strangers. To open a chat quickly, you have to find to have a resonat topic, which is why we always talk the gas when we first meet.

## 2. Write more about the premise

### 2.1. What a good premise looks like

-A good premise is an original observation.                                                       

We live in the same environment, and there are many things that we all experience but overlook. A good comedian will look at ordinary life and find unique perspectives from which to explore comedic material.

> Have you found that two people chatted with WeChat? Who sent the last message that this person is lower in the status between the two.
> 

When I tell this joke on stage, I often find the audience smile knowingly, which proves that I have said what they have also experienced. The reason is that this incident is a small detail of life kind, but it resonates with many people.

<aside>
💡 A good premise should be able to accurately answer the question:             What is it about [topic] that I find difficult/weird/fearful/stupid.
